We can represent truth-possibilities by the following kind of schema: (“p”, “q”, and “r” are elementary propositions. “T” means “true”, “F” “false”. The rows of “T’s” and “F’s” under the row of elementary propositions set out their truth-possibilities in a symbolism that can easily be understood):

Every proposition can be construed as the result of an operation which is performed on another proposition (the operation’s base) and turns the latter into the former.

Similarly we can speak of an operation with several bases. “(F)(p)” is the result of the operation “F( )” on the base p; (FTTF )(p, q) is the result of an operation on two bases.

If we construe (F)(p) as the result of an operation we write it as “(F)'p”; and in general an operation on “a”, “b”, “c”, etc. is written as O'(a, b, c, etc.).

Among the possible groups of truth-conditions there are two limiting cases.
4.446	13[4]	4.46 (2-3)*
In one case the proposition is true for all the truth-possibilities of the elementary propositions. We say that the truth-conditions are tautological.

A picture, conceived in this way, also includes the pictorial relationship which makes the picture a picture.

The pictorial relationship consists of the correlation of the picture's elements with things.
2.1516	14[10]	2.1515	15.10.14 (7)**
These correlations are, as it were, the antennae of the picture's elements, which put the picture in touch with reality.

4.1021	17[8]	4.121 (2)		19.4.15**
Language reflects what it cannot represent.

The method of inference can only be drawn from the two propositions.
5.0414	17[10]	5.132 (3)
Only they themselves can justify the inference.

“Laws of inference”, which—as in Frege and Russell—are supposed to justify inferences, are senseless and would be superfluous.
4.10011	17[12]	4.11**
The totality of true propositions can also be called the whole of natural science (or the totality of the natural sciences).
[104:18]
4.10012	18[1]	4.111 (1)
Philosophy is not one of the natural sciences.
4.10013	18[2]	4.111 (2)*		AüL 207 (3)**
The word “philosophy” must mean something that stands above or below the natural sciences, not alongside them.
4.10014	18[3]	4.112 (1)
The goal of philosophy is the logical clarification of thoughts.
4.10015	18[4]	4.112 (2)
Philosophy is not a theory but an activity.
4.10016	18[5]	4.112 (4)
Philosophy does not result in “philosophical propositions”, but rather in making propositions clear.
4.100161	18[6]	4.112 (5)
Philosophy should make clear and sharpen the boundaries of thoughts that are otherwise opaque and blurred.
4.10017	18[7]	4.114 (1)**
It should mark off the thinkable and thereby the unthinkable.
4.100171	18[8]	4.114 (2)**
It should mark off the unthinkable by working through the thinkable from within.
4.10018	18[9]	4.115
It will signify the unsayable, by clearly representing the sayable.
5.32	18[10]	5.53		29.11.14 (3)+
Identity of object I express by identity of sign, and not by means of a sign of identity. Difference of objects I express by difference of signs.
5.331	18[11]	5.531*
Thus I do not write “F (a, b).a =b”, but “F (a, a)” (or “F (b, b)”); and not “F (a, b).a≠b”, but “F (a, b)”.
5.332	18[12]	5.532**
And analogously: not “(∃x, y).F(x, y).x=y”, but “(∃x).F(x, x)”; and not “(∃x, y).F(x, y).x≠y”, but “(∃x, y).F(x, y)”.
(So instead of Russell's “(∃x, y).F(x, y)”: “(∃x, y).F(x, y) v (∃x).F(x, x)”.)
5.3321	18[13]	5.5321**
Instead of “(x).Fx ⊃ x=a” we therefore write “Fa:~(∃xy).Fx.Fy”. And the proposition, “Only one x satisfies F(x̂ )”, will be “(∃x).Fx:~(∃x, y).Fx.Fy”.
[104:19]
5.3.33	19[1]	5.533
Therefore the identity sign is not an essential component of conceptual notation.
5.334	19[2]	5.534		29.11.14 (4)+
And now we see that pseudo-propositions like “a =a”, “a =b . b = c .⊃a =c”, “(x).x=x”, “(∃x ).x =a”, etc. cannot even be written down using correct conceptual notation.
5.3341	19[3]	5.535 (1)
This also clears up all the problems that were connected with such pseudo-propositions.
4.1022	19[4]	4.121 (3)**
That which expresses itself in language, we cannot express by means of language.
4.10221	19[5]	—
So the logical structure of a situation is mirrored in a proposition - we cannot express it by means of language - the proposition shows it.
4.102211	19[6]	4.1211 (1)**
Thus the proposition “ϕ(a)” shows that the object a occurs in its sense //it is about a// and the propositions “ϕb” and “ψb” show that the same object occurs in their senses //they are about the same object//.
4.102212	19[7]	4.1211 (2)+
Two propositions which contradict one another show that they do so. Likewise, if one proposition follows from others, this is shown in the propositions themselves. And so on.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
4.10222	19[8]	4.122 (1)+
In a certain sense we can talk about structural properties of facts or about structural relations between them.
4.10223	19[9]	4.122 (4)+
However it is impossible to assert by means of propositions that such properties and relations obtain: rather, this shows itself in the propositions that represent the structures.
4.10224	19[10]	4.124 (1)
The obtaining of an internal property of a possible situation is not expressed by means of a proposition: rather, it expresses itself in the proposition representing the situation, by means of an internal property of the proposition.
[104:20]
4.10225	20[1]	4.125
That an internal relation obtains between possible situations expresses itself in language by means of an internal relation between the propositions representing them.
4.102231	20[2]	4.122 (2)*
Instead of “structural property” we also say “internal property”; instead of “structural relation”, “internal relation”.
5.32041	20[3]	5.525 (2)**
The certainty, possibility, or impossibility of a situation is not expressed by a proposition, but by whether what represents the situation is a tautology, a proposition with sense, or a contradiction.
5.3204	20[4]	5.525 (1)*
It is wrong to render the proposition “(∃x).ϕx” in the words, “ϕx is possible”, as Russell does.
5.005	20[5]	3.317 (1)**   5.501 (4)+
Values for a sentential variable are stipulated by indicating the sentences which the variable represents.
5.00501	20[6]	3.317 (2)
The description of those sentences is the stipulation.
5.0051	20[7]	3.317 (3)**
The stipulation will therefore be concerned only with signs, not with their meaning.
5.0052	20[8]	3.317 (4)**
And all that is essential to the stipulation is that it merely describes the signs and states nothing about the signified.
5.0053	20[9]	3.317 (5)   5.501 (5)+
The way in which the sentences are described is inessential.
5.0041	20[10]	3.316 (2) 
The stipulation of values is the variable.
[104:21]
5.00531	21[1]	5.501 (6)+
We can distinguish three kinds of description: 1. Direct enumeration. 2. Giving a function F (x , y, … ) whose various values are the propositions to be described. 3. Giving features which characterize those propositions.
4.102233	21[2]	4.1221
An internal property of a fact can also be called a feature of that fact (in the sense that we speak of facial features).
4.102234	21[3]	—
A feature characterizes a class of facts, if they and only they possess it.
5.00532	21[4]	5.501 (6)+
In the first case we can simply replace the variable with its (constant) values.
5.00533	21[5]	5.501 (6)+
In the second case the variable is a generalized proposition.
5.00534	21[6]	5.501 (6)+
In the third case the values of the variable are all propositions that possess certain formal properties.
5.005341	21[7]	4.1273 (1)+
This second kind of generalization, which can be called the formal kind, was
overlooked by Russell and Frege.
5.005342	21[8]	4.1273 (1)+
For example, all propositions of the series: aRb, (∃x).aRx.xRb, 
(∃x, y).aRx.xRy.yRb, etc. are characterized by a formal property.
5.00535	21[9]	4.1273 (1)+
The general form of these propositions can be presented only by means of the form of a variable.
5.005351	21[10]	4.1273 (1)+
Russell’s presentation is incorrect: it contains a vicious circle.
4.1022501	21[11]	4.1251
Now this settles the disputed question “whether all relations are internal or external”.
4.102253	21[12]	4.126 (1) 
In the same sense that we can speak of formal properties, we can now talk of formal concepts.
[104:22]
4.102254	22[1]	4.126 (2)*
I introduce this expression to make clear the the confusion of formal concepts and proper concepts, which runs through all of the old logic.
4.102232	22[2]	4.122 (3)*
I introduce these expressions to show the reason for the confusion between structural relations and proper (external) relations, so common among philosophers.
4.102261	22[3]	4.126 (4)
Unlike proper concepts, formal concepts cannot be represented by a function.
4.102262	22[4]	4.126 (5)*
This is because their characteristic marks—formal properties—are not expressed by functions.
4.102263	22[5]	4.126 (6)**
The expression of a formal property is a feature of a propositional structure.
4.102265	22[6]	4.126 (8)*
And so the expression for a formal concept is a propositional variable in which this distinctive feature alone is constant.
4.102264	22[7]	4.126 (7)*
So the sign for the characteristic mark of a formal concept is the distinctive feature of all propositions whose senses fall under the concept.
4.102271	22[8]	4.1271 (1)**
In a similar sense, each variable is the sign of a formal concept.
[104:23]
4.1022721	23[1]	4.1272 (1)*
Thus the variable name x is the proper sign of the pseudo-concept “object”.
4.1022722	23[2]	4.1272 (2)*
Wherever the word, object (or thing, entity, etc.), is correctly used, it is expressed in conceptual notation by a variable name.
4.1022723	23[3]	4.1272 (3)*	MN 212 (7)+
For example, in the proposition “There are 2 objects such that…”, by “(∃x, y)…”.
4.1022724	23[4]	4.1272 (4)
Wherever it is used otherwise, that is as a proper concept-word, nonsensical psuedo-propositions are the result.
4.1022725	23[5]	4.1272 (5)
So for instance one cannot say “There are objects”, as one might say, “There are books”. And it is equally impossible to say, “There are 100 objects” or “There are א0 objects”.
4.1022726	23[6]	4.1272 (7)*
What applies to the word “object” also applies similarly to the words “complex”, “fact”, “function”, “number”, etc., etc. 
4.1022727	23[7]	4.1272 (8)**
All these words signify, in the wider sense, formal concepts, and they are all represented in conceptual notation by variables, not by functions or classes.
4.1022728	23[8]	4.1272 (9)*
“1 is a number”, “There is only one 0”, and all similar expressions are nonsensical.
4.10226	23[9]	4.126 (3)*		MN 211 (4)+
Something’s being an instance of a formal concept cannot be expressed by a proposition. 
It is shown by the sign for the object itself. 
(A name shows that it signifies an object, a numeral that it signifies a number.)
[104:24]
4.10227	24[1]	4.127*
So the sentential variable signifies the formal concept, and its values signify the objects that are its instances.
4.102272	24[2]	4.1271 (2)*
For every variable represents a constant form that all its values possess, and this can be regarded as a formal property of those values.
4.102273	24[3]	4.1272 (8)**	(AüL207 (7)+)
“Object”, “complex”, “fact”, “number”, etc. etc. are not names of concepts - as Russell believed - but variables.
4.22131	24[4]	—
For the sake of brevity I also express the interchangeability of any two parts of propositions in the same way.
4.102241	24[5]	4.124 (2)
It would be just as nonsensical to ascribe formal property a proposition as to deny it.
4.10227251	24[6]	4.1272 (6)*
And it is nonsense to speak of the “total number of objects”.
3.20121	24[7]	3.31 (1-2)+
To put it concisely: I call a proposition as well as any part of a proposition a symbol.
3.20122	24[8]	3.31 (3)+
Every symbol is a proposition or a part of a proposition: thus symbols are what propositions have in common with one another.
3.22	24[9]	3.34 (1)
A proposition has essential and accidental features.
3.23	24[10]	3.34 (2)*		22.10.14 (1)+
Accidental features are those that are due to the particular way the sentential sign is produced. Essential features are those without which the sense of the proposition would be lost.
[104:25]
3.2016	25[1]	3.314 (1b)+
Every sign can be represented as a sentential variable.
3.24	25[2]	3.341 (1)
So what is essential about a proposition is what all sentences that can express the same sense have in common.
3.213	25[3]	3.13 (3)
And so a sentence does not yet contain its sense, but it does contain the possibility of expressing that sense.
3.214	25[4]	3.13 (5)
A sentence contains the form of its sense, but not its content.
3.211	25[5]	3.13 (1)*
A sentence has everything the projection has, except what is projected.
3.212	25[6]	3.13 (2)
Therefore, the possibility of what is projected is in the sentence, but not the  projection itself.
3.241	25[7]	3.341 (2)**
Likewise, generally, what is essential about a sign is what all signs that can serve the same purpose have in common.
3.2131	25[8]	3.13 (4)*
“The content of a sentence” means the content of a sentence that makes sense.
4.011	25[9]	4.011 (1a)
At first sight a sentence – say as it is set out on the printed page – does not seem to be a picture of the reality it is about.
4.0111	25[10]	4.011 (1b)
But neither does musical notation at first sight seem to be a picture of music, nor our phonetic notation (the letters of the alphabet) to be a picture of our spoken language.
4.0112	25[11]	4.011 (2)
And yet these sign-languages turn out to be pictures, even in the ordinary sense, of what they represent.
4.0113	25[12]	4.013 (1)
And if we penetrate to the essence of this pictorial character, we see that it is not hindered by apparent irregularities (such as the use of ♯ and ♭ in musical notation).
[104:26]
4.0114	26[1]	4.013 (2)
For even these irregularities depict what they are to express, only in a different way.
3.161	26[2]	3.143 (1)
That a sentential sign is a fact is concealed by the ordinary form of expression in writing or print.
3.162	26[3]	3.143 (2)
For in a printed sentence, for example, the sentential sign does not appear  essentially different from a word.
3.1621	26[4]	3.143 (3)*		AüL 193 (5)+
That is what made it possible for Frege to call a proposition a compound name.
3.163	26[5]	3.1431 (1)*
The essence of a sentential sign becomes very clear if we consider one made up not of written signs but of spatial objects (such as tables, chairs, books).
3.164	26[6]	3.1431 (2)
Then the spatial arrangement of these things expresses the sense of the proposition.
4.0115	26[7]	4.016 (1)*		29.9.14 (4)+
To understand the essence of a proposition, consider hieroglyphic writing, which admittedly depicts the facts it describes.
4.0116	26[8]	4.016 (2)
And from it came alphabetic writing, without losing what was essential to depiction.
2.021	26[9]	2.021
Objects make up the substance of the world. That is why they cannot be composite.
[104:27]
2.0211	27[1]	2.0211		MN 221 (3)+
If the world had no substance, then whether a proposition made sense would depend on whether another proposition was true.
2.0212	27[2]	2.0212
In that case we could not form a picture of the world (true or false).
2.022	27[3]	2.022
Obviously an imagined world, however different from the real world, must have something - a form - in common with it.
2.023	27[4]	2.023
This fixed form consists of objects.
2.0231	27[5]	2.0231*
The substance of the world can only determine a form, and not any material properties. Material properties can only be represented by means of propositions – they can only be produced by the configuration of objects.
2.0232	27[6]	2.0232
Roughly speaking, objects are colourless.
2.024	27[7]	2.024
Substance is what persists independently of what is the case.
2.025	27[8]	2.025
It is form and content.
2.0251	27[9]	2.0251**
Space and time are forms of objects.
2.0252	27[10]	2.0251+
In the same way colour (being coloured) is a form of visual objects.
2.026	27[11]	2.026		17.6.15 (11)+
Only if there are objects, can the world have a fixed form.
2.027	27[12]	2.027
Objects, the fixed, and the persistent are one.
2.0271		28[1]	2.0271
Objects are what is fixed and persistent; their configuration is what is changing and variable.
2.0272		28[2]	2.0272
The configuration of objects forms an elementary fact.

If one does not notice that propositions make sense independently of the facts, one can easily believe that true and false are relations of equal value between signs and what they signify.
4.0911		28[4]	 4.061 (2)*	AüL 194 (3)*
(One could then say, for instance, that “p” truly signifies what “~p” falsely signifies, etc.).

“Can we not make ourselves understood with false propositions just as we have done up to now with true ones, so long as we know that they are meant to be false?”
4.092		28[6]	 4.062*		AüL 194 (3)*
No! For a proposition is true if what it asserts is the case; and if by “q” we mean ~q and that’s the case, then“q” is true on the new conception, and not false.
4.0921		28[7]	4.0621 (1)*	AüL 194 (3)*
But it is important that the signs “p” and “~p” can say the same thing. For it shows that the sign “~” corresponds to nothing in reality.
4.0922		28[8]	4.0621 (2)
That negation occurs in a proposition is not a characteristic mark of its sense (~~p = p).
2.0601		28[9]	2.06 (2)*
We also call the obtaining of elementary facts a positive fact, and their non-obtaining a negative fact.
[104:29]

We can say that “~Socrates” means nothing because there is no property called ~(x).
3.2012		29[2]	3.322**		AüL 193 (4)
Signifying two objects by the same name but using two different modes of signification can never indicate a common characteristic. 
For the name is of course arbitrary. So we could choose two different names instead, and then where would there be what was in common in the signifying?
4.094		29[3]	4.063*		AüL 197 (1)*
An analogy to illustrate the concept of truth.  A black spot on white paper; the form of the spot can be described by saying for each point on the sheet whether it is black or white. To the fact that a point is black there corresponds a positive fact, and to the fact that a point is white (not black), a negative fact. If I designate a point on the sheet (a Fregean truth-value), then this corresponds to the supposition that is put forward for judgment, etc. etc.
However, to be able to say that a point is black or white, I must first know when a point is called black, and when white: I cannot say “p” is true (or false) unless I have determined in what circumstances I call p true, and in so doing I determine the sense of the proposition.
Now the point where the simile breaks down is this: we can pick a point on the paper even if we don’t know what black and white are, but if a sentence makes no sense, nothing at all corresponds to it, for it designates no thing (a truth-value) which might have properties called “false” or “true”. The verb of a proposition is not “is true” or “is false”, as Frege thought: rather, that which “is true” must already contain the verb.

Human beings have the capacity to construct languages in which every sense can be expressed, without having any idea how and what each word means,  just as we speak without knowing how the individual sounds are produced.

The interdefinability of Frege's and Russell's “primitive signs” of logic shows by itself that they are not primitive, still less signs for relations.

If we turn a constituent of a proposition into a variable, the resulting variable proposition will have a class of propositions as its values. In general, this class still depends on what we, by arbitrary convention, mean by parts of that original proposition. But if we turn all the signs in it that have arbitrarily determined meanings into variables,there will still always be such a class. This one, however, is not dependent on any convention, but solely on the nature of the proposition. It corresponds to a logical prototype - a logical form.

If logic has primitive ideas, they must be independent of one another. If a primitive idea is introduced, it must be introduced for all the contexts in which it occurs at all. One cannot, therefore, introduce it first for one context and then again for one another. For instance, once negation is introduced, we must understand it both in propositions of the form ~p and in propositions like ~(p ∨q), (or (∃x).~ϕx), etc. We cannot introduce it first for one class of cases and then for the other, since it would then remain doubtful whether its meaning were the same in both cases, and there would be no reason for using the same kind of connective in both cases.

It is quite natural to confuse the arguments of functions with the indexes of names. For I recognize equally well from the argument and the index what is meant by the signs containing them.

But that is due to an arbitrary convention and we could have chosen a simple sign instead of “+c”; in “~p”, however, “p” is not an index but an argument; the sense of “~p” cannot be understood unless one already understands the sense of p.

There are certain cases in which one is tempted to use expressions of the form a =a or p ⊃p and the like.

It is nonsense to use p ⊃p as an antecedent hypothesis to ensure that its consequent arguments have the right form.

However independent things may be - and this means no more than that they can occur in all possible situations - still this form of independence is a form of connection with elementary facts, a form of dependence.

What this comes to is that if it were the case that names had meaning both when combined in propositions and outside them, it would, so to speak, be impossible to guarantee that in both cases they really had the same meaning, in the same sense of the word. It seems to be impossible for words to appear in two different roles: alone, and in propositions.

Must the sign of a negative proposition be constructed with that of the positive proposition? Why should it not be possible to express a negative proposition by means of a negative fact? (For instance, if “a” does not stand in a certain relation to “b” it could express that not-aRb is the case.)
5.3102	50[3]	5.5151 (2)
Yet even in this case the negative proposition is constructed by indirectly relying on the positive.

The positive proposition necessarily presupposes the existence of the negative proposition, and vice versa.

We can express what is common to all notations for truth-functions in the following way: for instance, they have in common that they all can be replaced by a notation that uses ~ξ and ξ∨η.

A definite logical combination of signs corresponds to a definite logical combination of their meanings. It is only to the uncombined signs that absolutely any combination corresponds. That is, propositions that are true for every situation cannot be combinations of signs at all, for otherwise, only definite combinations of objects would correspond to them. 
(And what isn’t a logical combination has no combination of objects corresponding to it.)
5.04111	52[1]	5.131**
If one proposition follows from others, this is expressed by certain relations in which the forms of those propositions stand to one another: nor need we to set up this relation between them, by combining them with one another in a single proposition. On the contrary, the relations are internal, and  exist simultaneously with, and through, the existence of the sentential signs.
5.04112	52[2]	5.1311 (1)
When from p ∨q and ~p we infer q, the relation between the propositional forms of “p ∨q” and “~p” is concealed, by our mode of signifying. But if instead of “p ∨q” we write “p |q.|.p|q”, and instead of “~p”, “p|p” (p|q = neither p nor q), then the inner connection becomes obvious.
5.04113	52[3]	5.1311 (2)**	24.11.14 (2)
That we can infer from (x).ϕx to ϕa shows that the symbol “(x).ϕx” itself  already has generality in it.

If a sign is possible, it is also capable of signifying. Whatever is possible in logic is also permitted. (“Socrates is Plato” is nonsense because we have not made an arbitrary determination, and not because the sign, in itself, would be illegitimate.) In a certain sense, we cannot go wrong in logic.
5.30631	53[1]	5.4731*		8.9.14
The self-evidence that Russell talked about so much, can be dispensed with in logic, only because language itself prevents every logical mistake. – That logic is a priori consists in this: one cannot think illogically.
5.3064	53[2]	5.4733 (1-2)*	2.9.14 (2)
Frege says: any legitimately constructed proposition must have a sense. And I say: any possible proposition is well-formed, and, if it doesn’t make sense, that can only be because we have failed to give a meaning to some of its constituents. Even if we think we have.
5.30641	53[3]	5.4733 (3)*
Thus the reason why “Socrates is identical” says nothing is that we have given no adjectival meaning to the word “identical”. For when it appears as a sign for identity, it symbolizes in an entirely different way - the signifying relation is different - therefore the signs  in the two cases are entirely different, too: the two signs have only their visible part in common by accident.
3.2013 Schonvorh 53[4]	3.32, 3.321
A sign is the perceptible part of a symbol. Two different symbols can therefore have one and the same sign (written or spoken etc.)  in common - in which case each will signify in a different way.
3.2014	54[1]	3.323 (1)*		AüL 207 (5)+
Now in ordinary language it very often happens that the same word signifies in different ways - and so belongs to different symbols - or that two words that signify in different ways are applied in sentences in what looks like the same way.
3.20141	54[2]	3.323 (2-3)**
Thus the word “is” appears as a copula, as a sign for identity, and as an expression for existence; the word “Green” figures as an adjective and as the proper name of a person; “identical” is employed as an adjective, etc. etc. In the proposition “Green is green” (when “is” means the copula) not only do the first word and the last have different meanings, they are different symbols.
3.20142	54[3]	3.324
This is how the most fundamental confusions easily arise (all philosophy is full of them).
3.2015	54[4]	3.325 (1)*
To avoid such errors we must use a sign-language that excludes them by not using the same sign for different symbols and by not using signs that signify in different ways in what looks like the same way. That is to say, a sign-language governed by logical grammar - by logical syntax.
3.20151	54[5]	3.325 (2)*
Frege’s and Russell’s conceptual notation is such a language that, howevever – as will be shown – still does not exclude all mistakes.
3.251	55[1]	3.344		MN 221 (2)**
A symbol signifies in virtue of what is common to all those symbols by which it can be replaced according to the rules of logical syntax.
3.252	55[2]	3.326**		23.10.14 (6)**
To recognize a symbol in its sign we must observe how it is used.
3.20152	55[3]	3.33**  3.331**
The meaning of a sign should never play a role in logical syntax. It must be possible to set up logical syntax without mentioning the meaning of a sign: only the description of symbols may be presupposed. From this observation we get a further perspective on Russell's “theory of types”.  Russell’s error is shown by the fact that in formulating his rules for signs, he had to mention his signs’ meanings.
4.4221	55[4]	4.431 (3)*
So Frege was quite right to start with them in explaining the signs of his conceptual notation. But Frege’s explanation of the concept of truth is wrong: if “the true” and “the false” were real objects, and were the arguments in ~p, etc., then the sense of ~p would not in the least be determined by Frege's  “determination.”

It has to be possible to answer a priori the question whether I can get into a position in which I need a 27-termed relation to signify something.

5.404	57[2]	5.5542 (2)
Does it make sense to ask what there must be such that something can be the case?
5.414	57[3]	5.5563
All the propositions of our ordinary language are actually, just as they are, in perfect logical order. - That utterly simple thing, that we have to formulate here, is not a likeness of the truth, but the complete truth itself.

However, whether a sign like F (a, b, c, …) is analyzable or not does not show itself in the sign. Rather, if it is analyzable, that shows itself in the signifying relation, and so in the sign's possessing a definition that analyzes it and that has sense.
5.422	57[7]	—
For elementary propositions we use the signs “p0”, “q0”, “r0”, etc. or “f0(a)”, “f0(a, b)”, etc. where it is left open whether or not a=b.

A complex can be given only by its description, which either will fit or not fit. A proposition that mentions a complex that does not exist will not be nonsensical, merely false.

When a simple symbol signifies a complex, this can be seen in an indeterminateness in the propositions in which it occurs. We then know that everything is not yet determined by the proposition. Indeed, the generality sign contains a prototype.
3.2531	59[1]	3.3442		23.5.15 (6)*
Analysis does not give an arbitrary resolution of the sign for a complex: for instance, it would not have a different resolution in every propositional structure.

The contraction of a symbol for a complex into a simple symbol can be expressed in a definition.

So one could say that the real name is what all symbols that could signify an object have in common. It would then follow, step by step, that no kind of composition was essential to a name.

The solutions to logical problems must be simple, since they set the standard of simplicity.

The requirement of determinacy could also be put as follows: if a proposition is to have sense, the syntactic role of each of its parts must have been settled beforehand. For instance, it cannot occur to one only later on that a certain proposition follows from it. Before a proposition can have a sense, it must be completely settled what propositions follow from it.
3.2513	60[9]	3.334

“~p” is true if “p” is false. Therefore, in the proposition “~p”, when true, “p” is false. How then can the hook “~” make it agree with reality?
5.313	61[7]	5.512 (2-3)*	20.10.14 (5)*
What negates in “~p” is not the “~”: rather, the negating is done by what all the signs of this notation have in common. That is, the common rule governing the construction of ~p, ~~~p, ~p ∨~p, ~p .~p, etc., etc. (ad inf.). And this common factor mirrors negation.
5.041031	61[8]	5.1241 (1)		AL 204 (8)+
“p.q” is one of the propositions that affirm “p” while also being one of the propositions that affirm “q”.
5.3131	61[9]	5.513 (1)		2.5.15+
It could be said that the proposition “p.q” is what is common to all symbols that affirm both p and q. The proposition “p∨q” is what is common to all symbols that affirm either p or q.

It must show itself in our sentential signs that it can only be sentential signs that are connected by “∨”, “.”, etc.
And this is indeed so, for the symbol in “p” and “q” itself presupposes “∨”, “.”, etc. If the sign “p” in “p∨q” does not stand for a complex sign, then it cannot make sense by itself: but then the signs “p∨p”, “p.p”, etc., which have the same sense as “p”, must also not make sense. However, if “p∨p” makes no sense, then “p∨q” cannot make sense either.

It follows from this that logical propositions are not unconditionally necessary; for in a suitable notation we can in fact recognize the structural properties of the propositions merely by inspecting them.

If, for example, two propositions p and q combine in p⊃q to yield a tautology, then clearly q follows from p. For instance, that “q” follows from “p⊃q.p” can be seen from the two propositions themselves, but we can also show it by combining them to form “p⊃q.p.⊃.q”, and then showing that this is a tautology.

Logical propositions demonstrate the logical properties of propositions, by combining them into propositions that say nothing.
6.1212	65[3]	6.121 (2)
This method could also be called a zero-method. In a logical proposition, propositions are brought into equilibrium with one another, and the state of equilibrium then shows how these propositions must be logically composed.

Indeed in everyday life we never need logical propositions. Rather, we make se of logical propositions only to infer from propositions that are not part of logic to others that also are not logical.

It is the characteristic mark of logical propositions that one can recognize that they are true from the symbol alone, and this fact contains in itself the whole philosophy of logic. And so too it is one of the most important facts that the truth or falsity of nonlogical propositions cannot be recognized from the propositions alone.

The correct explanation of logical propositions must give them a unique position among all propositions.
6.1002	66[5]	6.111**
Theories that make a proposition of logic appear to have a large amount of content are always false. For example, the words “true” and “false” seem to signify two properties among other properties, and then it seems to be a remarkable fact that every proposition has one of these properties. This now seems to be no more obvious than the proposition “All roses are either yellow or red” would seem, even if it were true. Indeed, the logical proposition acquires all the characteristics of a proposition of natural science, and this is a sure sign that it has been wrongly construed.
6.1216	66[6]	6.1224
Now it also becomes clear why logic was called the theory of forms and of inference.

The logical propositions describe the scaffolding of the world, or rather, they represent it. They are not “about” anything. They presuppose that names  mean something and elementary propositions make sense: and this is their connection with the world. Clearly, that certain combinations of symbols, symbols with a necessarily determinate character, are tautologies indicates something about the world. That’s the decisive point. We have said that in the signs we use, some things are arbitary, some things are not. In logic it is only the latter that express: but that means that in logic it is not we who express what we want by means of of signs, but rather in logic the nature of the inevitably necessary signs speaks for itself. If we know the logical syntax of any sign language, then all the logical propositions are already given.

The investigation of logic means the investigation of all that is subject to law. And outside logic, all is accident.

General validity is not the mark of logical propositions. To be general only means to be accidentally valid for all things.
6.1141	68[3]	  6.1231 (2b)
An ungeneralized proposition can be a tautology just as well as a generalized one.
6.12111	68[4]	6.1222
This throws light on the question why logical propositions can no more be confirmed by experience than they can be refuted by it. Not only must a proposition of logic be  incapable of being contradicted by any possible experience, it must likewise be unconfirmable by any possible experience.

We could call the general validity of logic essential, as opposed to the accidental general validity of such propositions as “All people are mortal”. Propositions like Russell's axiom of reducibility are not logical propositions, and this explains our feeling that, if true, that could only be a lucky fluke.

We can imagine a world in which the axiom of reducibility is not valid. But clearly, logic has nothing to do with the question whether our world is really like that or not.

In philosophy the question, “How do we actually use this word or this proposition?” repeatedly leads to valuable insights.
6.11341	69[6]	6.126 (3)*
Here is how we prove a logical proposition: we generate it from other logical propositions by successively applying certain operations that always produce further tautologies from the first. (And only tautologies follow from a tautology.)
6.11342	70[1]	6.126 (4)
Naturally this way of showing that propositions are tautologies is quite inessential to logic. For the propositions from which the proof starts must show without any proof that they are tautologies.
6.1135	70[2]	6.127
All propositions in logic are of equal rank, rather than some being essentially primitive propositions from which others are derived. Every tautology itself shows that it is a tautology.

Newtonian mechanics, for instance, puts world description into a uniform form. Imagine a white surface with irregular black spots. We then say: whatever kind of picture these make, I can always get as near as I like to its description, provided I cover the surface with a sufficiently fine square mesh, and then say of every square whether it is white or black. In this way I put the description of the surface into a uniform form. The form is arbitrary, because I could have just as well applied a net with a triangular or hexagonal mesh. It might be that the description would then have been simpler, that is, we might well described the surface more accurately with a coarser triangular mesh than with a finer square mesh or vice versa, and so on. The different nets correspond to different systems of describing the world. Mechanics determines a form of world description by saying: all propositions used in the description of the world must be obtained in a given way from a given set of propositions - the mechanical axioms. In this way it supplies the bricks for building the edifice of science, and says: Whatever building that you want to erect, must somehow be constructed with these, and only these, bricks.
(Just as within the number system we must be able to write down any arbitrary number, so within the system of mechanics we must be able to write down any arbitrary proposition ofphysics.)

And here we can see the position of logic in relation to mechanics. (We could also construct the net from different kinds of mesh.) That such a a picture can be described by a net of a given form tells us nothing about the picture. (For this holds of every picture of this kind.) But what does characterize a picture is that it can be described completely by a specific net of a specific fineness. 
Likewise, that the world can be described by Newtonian mechanics tells us nothing about the world: but what does tell us something about it is that the world can be described in precisely this way. We are also told something about the world by the fact that it can be described more simply in one system of mechanics than in another.

When an ethical law of the form “Thou shalt…” is laid down, one's first thought is, “So then what if I don’t do it?” But clearly ethics has nothing to do with punishment and reward in the ordinary sense. So this question about the consequences of an action must be irrelevant. At least these consequences could not be events. For there must be something right about that question after all. There must be a kind of ethical reward and punishment, but these must be involved in the action itself. (And it is clear also that the reward must be something pleasant, the punishment something unpleasant.)

For let us suppose that the function F (fξ) could be its own argument: there would then be a proposition “F(F(ξ)”, in which case the outer function F and inner function F must have different meanings, since the inner one has the form Φ(fξ) and the outer one has the form ψ{Φ(fξ)}. The two functions have only the letter “F “ in common, which by itself signifies nothing.

Although every word has meaning via its definitions, this only means that these definitions are necessary to present in our sign language the full linguistic depiction of the thought to whose expression the word contributes. But the definitions can be left tacit and the word does not then lose its meaning, since it still stands in the same relation to the objects depicted by means of the definitions - only we do not specifically depict that relation. Naturally this often simplifies the sign language and makes understanding it much harder, for the decisive factor now lies outside the signs in the unstated relation to their objects.

+3.12	103[8]	3.12
A sign through which we express a thought, I call a sentential sign. - And a proposition is a sentential sign in its projective relation to the world.
+3.203	103[9]	3.203
A name means an object. The object is its meaning. (“A” is the same sign as “A”.)
+3.2	103[10]	3.2
In a proposition a thought can be expressed such that elements of the sentential sign correspond to the objects of the thought.
103[11]
[+n meaning the numbers in the correction.]
+3.201	104[1]	3.201
I call such elements “simple signs”, and such a proposition “completely analyzed”.
+3.21	104[2]	3.21
The configuration of objects in a situation corresponds to the configuration of simple signs in the sentential sign.
+3.3	104[3]	3.3
Only propositions make sense, only in the context of a proposition is a name meaningful.
+3.25	104[4]	3.26
A name cannot be further analysed by using definitions.  It is a primitive sign.
+3.251	104[5]	3.261
Every defined sign signifies via the signs by which it is defined, and the definitions point the way. Two signs, one a primitive sign and one defined by primitive signs, cannot signify in the same way. Names cannot be broken down further by using definitions. (This can’t be done to any sign that has meaning independently and on its own.)
+3.31	104[6]	3.31, 3.313a-b**
Any part of a proposition that characterizes its sense I call an expression (a symbol). (A proposition is itself an expression.) 
Everything that propositions can have in common with one another that is essential to their sense is an expression. (Every expression can its be signified by a variable proposition – in the limit case, as a proposition.)
An expression marks off//identifies// a form and a content.
+3.32	104[7]	3.32
A sign is what can be perceived of a symbol.
+3.321	105[1]	3.321
So one and the same sign (written or spoken, etc.) can be common to two different symbols - in which case they will signify in different ways.
+3.323	105[2]	3.323
In ordinary language it very often happens that the same word signifies in different ways - and so belongs to different symbols - or that two words that signify in different ways are applied in sentences in what looks like the same way.
Thus the word “is” appears as a copula, as a sign for identity, and as an expression for existence; “exist” figures as an intransitive verb like “go”, and “identical” as an adjective; we speak of something, but also of something's happening. 
(In the proposition, “Green is green” - where the first word is a proper name  and the last an adjective – not only do these words have different meanings, they are different symbols.)
+3.322	105[3]	3.322*
Signifying two objects by the same sign but using two different modes of signification can never indicate a common characteristic. For the sign is of course arbitrary. So we could choose two different signs instead, and then where would there be what was in common in the signifying?
+4.24	106[1]	4.24
Names are the simple symbols. I indicate them by single letters (“x”, “y”, “z”). An elementary proposition I write as a function of names, in the form “f(x)”, “g(x, y)”, etc. 
Or I indicate it by the letters “p”, “q”, “r”.
+5.15	106[2]	5.15
If “Tr” is the number of truth-grounds of proposition “r”, and Trs the number of truth-grounds of proposition “s” that are at the same time truth-grounds of “r”, then let us call the ratio: Trs/Tr the measure of the probability given by  proposition “r” to proposition “s”.
+5.152	106[3]	5.152
Propositions that have no truth-arguments in common with one other we call independent of one another. Two elementary propositions give one another the probability 1/2.
If p follows from q, then proposition “q” gives proposition “p” the probability 1. The certainty of logical inference is a limiting case of probability. (Application to tautology and contradiction.)
+5.153	106[4]	5.153
A proposition is in itself neither probable nor improbable. An event occurs or does not occur: there is no other alternative.
+5.154	107[1]	5.154		8.11.14 (4)+
Suppose that an urn contains an equal number of black and white balls (and no others). I draw one ball after another and put them back into the urn. Then by this experiment I can determine that the numbers of black and white balls drawn approach each other as the drawing continues.
So this is not a mathematical truth. 
Now, if I say, “It’s equally probable that I will draw a white ball as a black one”, this means: “All the circumstances known to me (including the laws of nature assumed as hypotheses) give no more probability to the occurrence of the one event than to that of the other.” That is, they give each event the probability 1/2, as can easily be seen from the above explanations. What I confirm by the experiment is that the occurrence of the two events is independent of the circumstances about which I have no closer knowledge.
+5.155	107[2]	5.155
The unit for a probability proposition is this: The circumstances—of which I have no further knowledge—give a certain degree of probability to the occurrence of a particular event.
3.311	108[1]	3.311
An expression presupposes the forms of all the propositions in which it can occur. It is the common characteristic mark of a class of propositions.
3.312	108[2]	3.312
It is therefore presented by the general form of the propositions that it characterizes. 
And in this form the expression will be constant and all else variable.
3.313	108[3]	3.313
An expression is thus presented by a variable whose values are the propositions containing the expression. (In the limiting case the variable becomes a constant, the expression a proposition.)
I call such a variable a “propositional variable”.
3.314	108[4]	3.314
An expression has meaning only in a proposition. All variables can be construed as propositional variables. 	
(Including variable names.)	
5.21	108[5]	5.21+
One can construe every proposition as the result of an operation that is performed on a number of propositions (the operation’s bases) and constructs that proposition out of them.
5.22	109[1]	5.22**
An operation is the expression of a relation between the forms of its result and of its bases. The operation expresses this relationship, by showing what one has to do with the one proposition in order to get the other.
+5.232	109[2]	5.232
A series is ordered by an internal relation equivalent to the operation by which one term is produced from another.
+5.233	109[3]	5.24 (2-3)*
An operation expresses the difference between the forms.
And what is common to the bases and the result of an operation is just the bases themselves.
5.24	109[4]	??
An operation is therefore an expression. 
It is represented by a variable. 
Its bases vary.
5.241	109[5]	??
I indicate an operation in general by a sign of the form “O'(p, q, ...)”. “p”, “q”, etc. are the bases of the operation, O'(ξ, η, ...), O'(p, q, ...) are its result.
5.2	109[6]	5.234 a+
Truth-functions are the results of operations with elementary propositions.
+5.2	110[1]	5.2**
We see that the structures of propositions stand in internal relations to one another.
+5.21	110[2]	5.21
We can highlight these internal relations by using a form of expression that represents a proposition as the result of an operation that produces it out of other propositions (the operation’s bases).
+5.22	110[3]	5.22
An operation is the expression of a relation between the structures of its result and of its bases.
+5.23	110[4]	5.23
The operation is what has to be done to the one proposition to make the other out of it.
+5.231	110[5]	5.231
And that will, of course, depend on their formal properties, the internal similarity of their forms.
+5.24	110[6]	5.24
An operation shows itself in a variable; it shows how we can get from one form of proposition to another. It expresses the difference between the forms. 
(And what is common to the bases and the result of an operation is just the bases themselves.)
+5.241	110[7]	5.241
An operation does not characterize a form, but only the difference between forms.
+5.25	110[8]	5.25
The occurrence of an operation does not characterize the sense of a proposition. Indeed, an operation states nothing, only its result does, and this depends on the operation’s bases. (Operations and functions must not be confused with each other.)
+5.233	111[1]	5.233
Operations can first arise when one proposition is generated out of another in a logically meaningful way; i.e. the point at which the logical construction of propositions begins.
+5.251	111[2]	5.251
A function cannot be its own argument, but the result of an operation can be its own basis.
+5.252	111[3]	5.252
Only in this way is the step from term to term in a formal series possible (from type to type in Russell and Whitehead’s hierarchies). (Russell and Whitehead did not allow such steps, but they took them again and again.)
+5.2521	111[4]	5.2521
The repeated application of an operation to its own result I call its successive application. (“O'O'O'a” is the result of three successive applications of the operation “O'ξ” to “a”.)
+5.253	111[5]	5.253
One operation can reverse the effect of another. Operations can cancel each other out.
+5.254	112[1]	5.254
Operations can vanish (e.g. negation in “~~p”: ~~p=p).
+5.234	112[2]	5.234
Truth-functions of elementary propositions are results of operations with elementary propositions as bases. (These operations I call truth-operations.)
+5.242	112[3]	5.242
The operation that produces “q” from “p” also produces “r” from “q”, and so on. This can only be expressed by “p”, “q”, “r”, etc. being variables that give general expression to certain formal relations.
+5.▫3	112[4]	5.3
All propositions are the result of truth-operations on elementary propositions.
A truth-operation is the way in which a truth-function is produced from elementary propositions.
It is essential to truth-operations that, just as elementary propositions yield a truth-function of themselves, so too truth-functions yield a further truth-function. Every truth-operation produces from truth-functions of elementary propositions another truth-function of elementary propositions, that is, another proposition. The result of every truth-operation on the results of truth-operations on elementary propositions is also the result of one truth-
operation on elementary propositions. 
Every proposition is the result of truth-operations on elementary propositions.
+5.2341	113[1]	5.2341*
The sense of a truth-function of p is a function of the sense of p.
(Negation reverses the sense of a proposition.) 
Negation, logical addition, logical multiplication, etc. etc. are operations.
+zu 5.2521	113[2]	5.2521 (2)
Similarly, I speak of successive applications of multiple operations to a number of propositions.
+5.32	113[3]	5.32
All truth-functions are results of the successive application of a finite number of truth-operations to elementary propositions.
+Zu 5.452	113[4]	5.452 (3)
But if we need to introduce a new device at some point, we must first ask “Where will the use of this device now be unavoidable?” Its place in logic must be made clear.
+5.501	114[1]	5.501
When the terms of a bracketed expression are propositions —and their order  inside the brackets is irrelevant—then I indicate this by a sign of the form “(ξ)”. “ξ” is a variable whose values are terms of the bracketed expression and the bar over it indicates that it represents all of its values in the brackets. 
(Thus if ξ has the three values P, Q, R, then (ξ)=(P, Q, R).) 
The values of the variable are stipulated.
The stipulation is a description of the propositions which the variable  represents.
The way in which the terms of the bracketed expression are described is inessential.
We can distinguish three kinds of description: 1) Direct enumeration. In this case we can simply substitute for the variable the constants that are its values. 2) Giving a function f(x) whose values for all values of x are the propositions to be described. 3) Giving a formal law that governs the construction of the propositions. In this case the terms of the expression in brackets are all the terms of a formal series.
4.1273	115[1]	4.1273*
To express the general proposition “b is a successor of a” in conceptual notation, we need an expression for the general term of the formal series: aRb, (∃x):aRx.xRb, (∃x,y):aRx.xRy.yRb, … .
To express the general term of a formal series we must use a variable, for the concept “term of this formal series” is a formal concept. (This is what Frege and Russell overlooked. Their way of expressing general propositions like the one above is, therefore, wrong; it contains a vicious circle.)
We can determine the general term of a formal series by giving its first term and the general form of the operation that produces the next term out of the preceding proposition.
5.2522	115[2]	5.2522
For the general term of the formal series a, O'a, O'O'a, … I use the sign “[a, x, O'x]”. This bracketed expression is a variable. The first term is the beginning of the formal series, the second is the form of a term x selected arbitrarily from the formal series, and the third is the form of the term immediately following x in the series.
5.5	116[1]	5.5 (1)
Every truth-function is a result of successive applications of the operation “(-----T )(ξ , . . . . .)” to elementary propositions.

(The number of terms in the right-hand pair of brackets determines the number of places in the left-hand pair.)
Zu 5.5	116[3]	5.5 (2)
This operation negates all the propositions in the right-hand pair of brackets, and I call it the negation of those propositions.
5.502	116[4]	5.502
So instead of “(-----T)(ξ, . . . . .)”, I write “N(ξ)”.
N (ξ) is the negation of all the values of the propositional variable ξ.
5.503	116[5]	5.503* 		13.7.16 (4) [Vgl. 83[7]]
Obviously, it is easy to express how propositions may and may not be constructed using this operation. So it must be possible to find a way of expressing this exactly.

That for example the propositions “p” and “~p” in the conjunction “~(p.~p)” yield a tautology shows that they contradict each other. That the propositions “p⊃q”, “p”, and “q”, conjoined into “(p ⊃q).(p):⊃:(q)”, yield a tautology shows that q follows from p and p⊃q.

Frege says that the two expressions have the same meaning but different senses. 
But the essential thing about an equation is that we do not need it to show that expressions connected by the sign of equality have the same meaning, for this can be seen from the two expressions themselves.

And that the propositions of mathematics can be proved means simply that their correctness can be perceived without our having to compare what they express with the facts to determine its correctness.

Preface
Perhaps this book will be understood only by those who have themselves already had the thoughts that are expressed in it—or similar thoughts.—So it is not a textbook.—Its purpose would be achieved if there were one person  who read it with understanding and to whom it gave pleasure. 
The book deals with the problems of philosophy, and shows, as I believe, that the formulation of these problems rests on a misunderstanding of the logic of our language. The whole sense of the book might be summed up in the following words: what can be said at all can be said clearly, and what we cannot talk about we must be silent.
The book aims, therefore, to draw a limit to thought, or rather—not to thought, but to the expression of thought: for in order to be able to draw a limit to thought, we should have to be able to think both sides of this limit (we should therefore have to be able to think what cannot be thought).
The limit can therefore only be drawn in language, and what lies on the other side of the limit will be simply nonsense.
120[0]
I do not wish to judge how far my efforts agree with those of other philosophers. Indeed, what I have written here makes no claim to novelty in detail, and therefore I give no sources, becaues it is indifferent to me whether what I have thoughts has already been thought by another.
I will only mention that I am indebted to Frege’s great works and to the writings of my friend Mr. Bertrand Russell I owe much of the stimulation of my thoughts.
If this work has a value it consists in two things. First that in it thoughts are expressed, and this value will be the greater the better the thoughts are expressed. The more the nail has been hit on the head, the greater will be its value.—Here I am conscious of having fallen far short of what is possible. Simply because my powers are insufficient to cope with the task.—May others come and do it better.
121[0]
On the other hand the truth of the thoughts communicated here seems to me unassailable and definitive. I therefore believe that the problems have in essentials, been finally solved. And if I am not mistaken in this, then the thing the value of this work secondly consists in showing how little has been achieved when these problems have been solved.
I thank my uncle Mr. Paul Wittgenstein und my friend Mr. Bertrand Russell for the affectionate encouragement they have given me.
