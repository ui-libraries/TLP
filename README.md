# TLP
An interactive Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus.

The site is built around a subway-style map, with the aim of displaying the overall structure of the numbering system, and making it easy to look at the sequences of propositions described in the introductory footnote, together with the remark that they comment on. This is the first _Tractatus_ website to provide a map of the bookâ€™s overall structure, and the only one that provides parallel access to the earlier versions of the text in the _Prototractatus_.

Uses the following libraries:

* d3
* jQuery
* lodash
* svg-pan-zoom
* hammer
* MathJax
