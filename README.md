# TLP

uses the following JS libraries:

* Bootstrap
* jQuery
* jQuery-ui
* lodash
* d3
* svg-pan-zoom
* MathJax
* jsDiff

The application is built around a subway-style map, with the aim of displaying the overall structure of the numbering system, and making it easy to look at the sequences of propositions described in the introductory footnote, together with the remark that they comment on. This is the first Tractatus website to provide a map of the bookâ€™s overall structure, and the only one that provides parallel access to the earlier versions of the text in the Prototractatus.

Clicking on the individual remarks, or the lines connecting the remarks, brings up a panel containing the associated text.  The default text is the German original, but a dropdown menu in each text panel allows you to choose either of the canonical English translations. You can also zoom in on any part of the map, and then move around in it, or zoom out to see the whole. The site is still in the early stages of development, and we plan to improve and extend it in the future.
