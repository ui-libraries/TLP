                <p>Welcome to the University of Iowa Tractatus map.  We recommend using a modern browser such as Firefox or Chrome; Internet Explorer is not supported at this time.</p>
				
				<p>Ludwig Wittgenstein’s Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus consists of a series of numbered remarks, arranged in numerical order. The seven most important are numbered 1 to 7; decimal numbers are used to indicate the structure of the supporting paragraphs.  A footnote, attached to the first remark, tells the reader that</p>
				<blockquote>The decimal figures as numbers of the separate propositions indicate the logical  importance of the propositions, the emphasis laid upon them in my exposition. The propositions n.1, n.2, n.3, etc., are comments on proposition No. n; the propositions n.m1, n.m2, etc., are comments on the proposition No. n.m; and so on.</blockquote>
				
				<p>The site is built around a subway-style map, with the aim of displaying the overall structure of the numbering system, and making it easy to look at the sequences of propositions described in the introductory footnote, together with
 				the remark that they comment on.  Previous Tractatus websites have offered similar ways of displaying these sequences, and navigating from one to another, but have not mapped their overall structure, or earlier versions of the text.</p>
				
				<p>Clicking on the individual remarks, or the lines connecting the remarks, brings up a panel containing the associated text.  The default text is the German original, but a dropdown menu in each text panel allows you to choose either of the canonical English translations. You can also zoom in on any part of the map, and then move around in it, or zoom out to see the whole.  The site is still in the early stages of development, and we plan to improve and extend it in the future.</p>
				
				<p>The yellow main line at the top of the page, represents the whole-numbered remarks, (1, 2…7), each of which is represented by a station on that line.  The red and pink lines, branching off each of the first six remarks (1.1, 1.2, 1.3; 2.1, 2.2, 2.3; 2.01, 2.02, 2.03… and so on) represent the sequences of remarks that comment on the whole-numbered remarks.  Further levels of comments are represented by lines in orange, green, acqua, blue, purple and grey.</p>
				
				<p>Wittgenstein made use of numbers with one or more zeros so that he could have separate sets of comments on a single remark (such as 2.01, 2.02, 2.03…2.06 as well as 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, and 3.oo1, 3.01, 302… as well 3.1, 3.2… and so on).  We indicate these “centesimals” (comments with an initial zero) and millesimals (comments with two initial zeros) by paler versions of  the color for the corresponding remarks without a zero.</p>
				
				<p>The green button in the top left corner of the Tractatus map leads to a similar map of the Prototractatus, an early version of the Tractatus. By choosing different start and end pages at the top of that map, it's possible to see different stage in the construction of the Prototractatus: the chosen pages are in color, the others are greyed out. (The two principal stages are the 'core' Prototractatus, which ends at a dividing line on page 28, and the the so-called Proto-Prototractatus, which ends at a similar dividing line near the bottom of page 70).</p>
				
				<p>Phillip Ricks drafted the first version of the map, using a pencil and graph paper, while taking part in David Stern’s graduate seminar on the Tractatus. David turned it into an Excel spreadsheet, and suggested that we use it as the basis for an online map of both the Tractatus and the Prototractatus. Landon Elkind joined us in working on the design of the online map, and made a crucial contribution to the Prototractatus part of the project. The construction and design of the website was done by Matthew Butler and Nikki White at the University of Iowa Library’s Digital Scholarship and Publishing Studio. We are grateful to Kevin Klement for his editorial work on the public domain English and German editions of the Tractatus used on the site.</p>
